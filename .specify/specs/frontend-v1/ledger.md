# Campaign 027 — Frontend v1 · execution ledger

Durable source of truth between sessions. **Do not rely on conversational memory.**
Governing plan: [`plan.md`](plan.md). This file records state; the plan records intent.

---

## 1. Zero-trust resume block

Verify every line against live state before acting on it. Report drift before doing any work.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Repo** | `eslammuatamed-web` |
| **Worktree** | `/home/eslam-muatamed/worktrees/web-026-phase8` ⚠ directory name is historical (it was the 026 Phase 8 worktree); the branch it holds is the Frontend v1 campaign branch |
| **Branch** | `campaign/frontend-v1` |
| **Branched from** | `origin/dev` `54cea28737c558767ccb24a34e2b437b62f7f058` |
| **Remote state** | **NOT PUSHED.** `origin/dev` = `54cea287…`, `origin/main` = `648aa467…` — neither moved by this campaign |
| **Production** | Web release `20260817T175534Z-648aa46` — untouched |
| **API** | `origin/main` = `origin/dev` = `9af1aace…`, live and complete for v1 scope |

**Verify with:**
```bash
git -C /home/eslam-muatamed/worktrees/web-026-phase8 rev-parse HEAD --abbrev-ref HEAD
git -C /home/eslam-muatamed/worktrees/web-026-phase8 status --porcelain
git -C /home/eslam-muatamed/worktrees/web-026-phase8 fetch origin && git rev-parse origin/dev origin/main
```

## 2. Phase status

| Phase | State |
| --- | --- |
| **FE-1 — Contract & Integration Foundation** | **IN PROGRESS** — contract adoption + gtm reconciliation DONE; reply flow deliberately deferred to FE-2 (see §5) |
| FE-2 — Articles Tracer Bullet + Dashboard Architecture | NOT STARTED |
| FE-3 — Content Module Replication | NOT STARTED |
| FE-4 — System Modules | NOT STARTED |
| FE-5 — Coherence, D20-32 Review, M4 Closure | NOT STARTED |

---

## 3. Settled owner decisions — do not re-litigate

| ID | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| **OD-1** | Full Dashboard M3 **IS** in Frontend v1. Hold the `M` bar. |
| **OD-2** | Dynamic **RBAC management UI is DEFERRED** from v1. Backend RBAC, enforcement, and role/permission-aware Frontend behaviour are all preserved. Record as POST-V1 product work, **not** an unfinished v1 requirement. |
| **OD-3** | Backend/API is complete and Production-ready for v1 scope unless fresh evidence proves otherwise. |
| **OD-9** | Dashboard UI locale **seeds the initial** translation tab; tab selection is thereafter independent per entity. |
| **OD-10** | Dashboard shell is **fully localized EN/AR** (a locale control in the header implies it). |
| **UX** | Multilingual authoring: shared fields once + locale tabs; preserved unsaved state; validation visible across inactive tabs; correct RTL/LTR; 380px. |
| **UX** | Dashboard shell needs locale control, appearance control, obvious **View/Open Portfolio**, contextual **View-on-site** where a real public destination exists. |
| **UX** | `/dashboard/login` gets a full product-quality redesign — Nuxt UI + standard Zod, obvious way back to the public site. |
| **UX** | Long authoring flows: **one coherent page + clear sections + locale tabs + persistent primary actions**. No wizard without workflow evidence. |

---

## 4. Rejected approaches, and why

| Rejected | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Hand-authoring the three SEO route types | Owner instruction and doc 16 §3 — types are generated from the contract, never written by hand. |
| Removing `} as SiteSettings` casts from `Partial`-spread fixtures | The cast is **forced** by TypeScript widening spread properties to `T \| undefined`, not sloppiness. Removing it yields TS-limitation noise, not safety. Recorded as a post-v1 factory-helper improvement instead. |
| Deleting `replyMailto()` | **FR-DSH-060 explicitly preserves it**: "Replying from the owner's own email client remains available and is unaffected." The dashboard reply is an addition, not a replacement. |
| Building the Dashboard reply UI during FE-1 | It is Dashboard **UI**, governed by the FE-2 form/validation/feedback patterns that do not exist yet. Building it first is throwaway work the tracer-bullet sequencing exists to prevent. |
| Trusting an `app/`-scoped grep for the fixture sweep | It missed `scripts/e2e/` fixtures entirely. The contract-fixtures gate caught them. Sweep the **repo**, not a directory. |

## 5. Measurements and gate results

### FE-1

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Contract paths (Web) | 49 → **52**, matching API `origin/main` |
| API `origin/main` contract vs **live** `/docs-json` | `jq -S` normalized → **STRUCTURALLY IDENTICAL** |
| `npm run api:types` fixed point | second generation **byte-identical** |
| `npm run typecheck` | **exit 0**, 0 errors |
| `npm test` (first run, pre-fixture-fix) | **exit 1** — 2 failures, both real drift in `scripts/e2e/` fixtures |
| `scripts/e2e/contract-fixtures.spec.ts` (isolated, post-fix) | **26/26 passed** |
| `npm test` (full, post-fix) | **exit 0** — 104 files, **1501/1501 passed** |
| `npm run lint` | **exit 0** |

**Instrument note.** The contract-fixtures gate **failed naturally** on real drift before it passed.
That failure is the discriminating evidence that it is live — no synthetic negative control was
needed for this gate.

**Build gates (`check:bundle`, `check:logical`, `size`, `size:routes`) not run for FE-1, by
argument rather than omission:** no runtime source changed. The diff is `openapi/openapi.json`,
the generated `app/types/api.d.ts` (types only — fully erased at compile), `*.spec.ts` fixtures and
`scripts/e2e/` mock-server fixtures. None ships in a client bundle, so no budget can move. CI will
run them anyway at the integration boundary.

**Exit-code note.** Two background wrappers reported harness exit 0 while the underlying command had
failed (a trailing `echo`/`tee` masked it). Always read the explicit `*_EXIT=` line, per the
`set -o pipefail` rule.

## 6. Known risks carried

| # | Risk |
| --- | --- |
| R2 | Public CSS budget ~0.9 KB headroom (29.08 / 30.00 KB gz) |
| R3 | D20-32 is INTERIM; 5 of 8 Dashboard routes lack accepted baselines — **do not recalibrate before FE-5** |
| R7 | Security posture stale — recount from paginated Dependabot API **plus** `npm audit`; carry no remembered count forward |
| R8 | Production rollback pointer unverified |
| R9 | `content:sync` never run — one project 404s in Production (content gap, not a defect) |
| R10 | `D19-11` id collision across Docs branches — blocks any Docs integration |
| R11 | Issue #30 hydration defect — `test:e2e:repeat` red by design, out of scope |
| — | **About portrait** is an owner content dependency for M4 closure; do not fabricate or substitute owner content |

## 7. Delegation results

None yet. No subagents or Codex lanes dispatched in this campaign.

## 8. Exact next action

1. Commit FE-1 as **two commits**: (a) atomic contract adoption — `openapi/openapi.json` +
   `app/types/api.d.ts` + fixture adaptation (doc 16 §3); (b) planning docs.
2. Close FE-1 and open **FE-2**, starting with the minimum viable Dashboard shell
   (`View site`, locale switcher beside the theme control, session menu) — it is a genuine
   prerequisite for designing FE-2's contextual public-view actions and list↔editor navigation.
3. Then build the Articles module as the tracer bullet, establishing `useTranslatableForm`,
   `TranslationTabs`, `EntityFormLayout` and the rest of §14.6 — **extracted only after the real
   Articles flow demonstrates the boundary**, never as an up-front framework.

**Push discipline:** nothing is pushed. No merge to `main`, no deploy, no Docs publication.
Accumulate a coherent near-final candidate and stop at the governed integration boundary.
